Driver的结构如下:

/**
 * _virDriver:
 *
 * Structure associated to a virtualization driver, defining the various
 * entry points for it.
 *
 * All drivers must support the following fields/methods:
 *  - no
 *  - name
 *  - open
 *  - close
 */

struct _virDriver {
    int        no;  /* the number virDrvNo */
    const char * name;  /* the name of the driver */
    virDrvOpen          open;
    virDrvClose         close;
    virDrvDrvSupportsFeature   supports_feature;
    ... --> 下面若干是一些方法
}
